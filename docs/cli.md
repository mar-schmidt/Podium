# Podium CLI reference

Podium ships two binaries:

- **`podiumd`** — the long-running daemon. Owns all session, agent, and schedule
  state; serves the web UI and API; runs the embedded scheduler.
- **`podium`** — a thin client that always talks to a running `podiumd`. It does
  not run sessions in-process (R11.1 / D2).

This page is kept in sync with the binaries' built-in help (`--help` on any
command is authoritative).

## Storage root

All Podium state lives under a single root:

- Default: `~/.podium/`
- Override: set the `PODIUM_HOME` environment variable.

On first start, `podiumd` scaffolds the tree and writes a commented default
`config.yaml`, the Podium-owned base `AGENTS.md`, and an empty project ledger.
Existing files are never overwritten.

## `podiumd`

Run the daemon (foreground):

```
podiumd
```

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--help` | Show help. |
| `--version` | Print version and commit. |

Bind address and port come from `config.yaml` (`server.bind`, `server.port`;
default `127.0.0.1:8787`).

## `podium`

Global flags:

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--addr host:port` | Daemon address. Precedence: `--addr` → `PODIUM_ADDR` → `config.yaml` → `127.0.0.1:8787`. |
| `--version` | Print version and commit. |

### Install scripts

Public copy-paste installers:

```
curl -fsSL https://github.com/mar-schmidt/Podium/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash
irm https://github.com/mar-schmidt/Podium/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex
```

The scripts download release archives, verify `SHA256SUMS`, install `podium` and
`podiumd`, optionally configure user-level autostart, then run `podium onboard`.
By default they download from GitHub Releases (`latest/download` for the default
install, or `download/<version>` when a version is specified).

CI publishes every commit to `master` as `v0.1.<github-run-number>`. This is a
monotonic pre-1.0 series: no calendar cadence is implied, and release bursts are
fine.

Common script options:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--version VERSION` / `-Version VERSION` | Release version, default `latest`. |
| `--install-dir DIR` / `-InstallDir DIR` | Binary install directory. |
| `--podium-home DIR` / `-PodiumHome DIR` | Set `PODIUM_HOME` for this install/autostart. |
| `--autostart ask|yes|no` / `-Autostart ask|yes|no` | Whether to start `podiumd` at login. |
| `--no-onboard` / `-NoOnboard` | Install only; skip first-run wizard. |
| `--source-fallback` / `-SourceFallback` | Build from source if release download fails. |

### `podium status`

Report whether the daemon is running, plus its version and uptime.

```
podium status
podium --addr 127.0.0.1:8787 status
```

Exits non-zero with a "start it with: podiumd" hint when the daemon is
unreachable.

### `podium doctor`

Check daemon reachability and native provider readiness.

```
podium doctor
```

The command never reads credentials. It locates `claude` and `codex`, prints
versions when available, and gives install/login hints when a provider is not
ready.

### `podium logs path`

Print the active daemon log path.

```
podium logs path
```

Logs live under `$PODIUM_HOME/logs` (default `~/.podium/logs`).

### `podium logs follow`

Print recent daemon log lines and keep following the active log across daily
rotation.

```
podium logs follow
podium logs follow -n 200
podium logs follow --no-follow
```

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--lines`, `-n` | Number of recent lines to print first (default 100). |
| `--no-follow` | Print recent lines and exit. |

### `podium update check`

Check GitHub Releases for a newer Podium build. This works without a running
daemon.

```
podium update check
podium update check --json
podium update check --version v0.1.123
```

`dev` and `*-dirty` builds are reported as non-release builds; applying an
update from them requires `--force`.

### `podium update apply`

Download, checksum-verify, extract, and install a release archive for the current
OS/architecture.

```
podium update apply --yes
podium update apply --version v0.1.123 --yes
podium update apply --force --yes
```

When `podiumd` is reachable, the CLI asks the daemon to coordinate the update so
the web UI and daemon restart together. If no daemon is reachable, the CLI
updates the sibling binaries directly. Updating may interrupt active turns or
scheduled runs because `podiumd` restarts.

Linux support is distro-neutral: releases ship static Go binaries, not distro
packages.

### `podium onboard` / `podium setup`

Run the first-use wizard.

```
podium onboard
podium setup
```

The wizard starts `podiumd` if needed, helps get Claude and/or Codex available,
asks personality/workstyle questions, creates the first agent, then asks a
working provider to draft the agent's `SOUL.md`. The generated soul is previewed
before saving, with regenerate and edit options.

### `podium agents list`

List durable agents known to the daemon.

```
podium agents list
```

### `podium agents create`

Create an agent through `podiumd`. This stores the agent, creates
`$PODIUM_HOME/agents/<name>/SOUL.md`, and creates its `workspace/`.

```
podium agents create jared
podium agents create builder --provider claude --model sonnet --effort medium --permission approve
```

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--provider claude|codex` | Provider for the agent. Empty inherits `global.provider`. |
| `--model name` | Default model. Empty means provider default. |
| `--effort level` | Default effort (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`). |
| `--permission approve|yolo` | Agent permission default. |

Choosing `--permission yolo` prints a whole-machine-access warning: in `yolo`
every tool call is auto-approved and the workspace is **not** a sandbox (R8.31).
See [Security & logging](security.md) for the full permission model.

### `podium agents delete`

Delete an agent through `podiumd`.

```
podium agents delete jared
```

The command requires typing the exact agent name before deletion. It archives
the agent's sessions as JSON files under
`$PODIUM_HOME/agents/<name>/workspace/session-archive/`, removes those sessions
from active history, removes the agent from Podium's database, and removes a
matching `config.yaml` `agents` entry when present. Files under
`$PODIUM_HOME/agents/<name>/` are preserved.

### `podium chat`

Send one chat turn through the daemon. Use `--agent` to create a new CLI-origin
session or `--session` to continue an existing session.

```
podium chat --agent jared "Summarise this workspace"
podium chat --session <session-id> "Continue"
```

In `approve` mode, permission requests are shown inline. Answer `y`/`yes` to
allow the requested tool input unchanged; any other answer denies it. Unanswered
requests auto-deny after `global.permission_timeout`.

Slash commands can be sent as the message body:

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/model <name>` | Set the session model for subsequent turns. |
| `/effort low|medium|high|xhigh|max` | Set reasoning effort. |
| `/profile <name|default>` | Switch auth profile. `default` clears the profile; the next turn replays history into a fresh backing session/thread. |
| `/permission approve|yolo` | Set permission mode. |
| `/name <text>` | Rename the session. |
| `/describe <text>` | Set the session description. |
| `/help` | Print command help. |

### `podium schedules list`

List every schedule file with its timing, agent, permission policy, next-run
time, and recent run count. See [scheduling.md](scheduling.md) for the file
format.

```
podium schedules list
```

Invalid files are shown with an `[invalid]` marker and the parse error rather
than being silently skipped.

### `podium schedules run`

Trigger a schedule immediately ("Run now"). The run executes a full agent turn
and creates a durable schedule-origin session you can revisit and continue
manually; the command prints the run id, status, and session id.

```
podium schedules run morning-calendar
```

A disabled schedule can still be run manually; only automatic firing is
suppressed while it is disabled.

### `podium projects list`

List the shared project ledger (`~/.podium/projects/projects.yaml`). See
[projects.md](projects.md).

```
podium projects list
```

### `podium tasks list`

List roadmap tasks with their status, assigned agent, and project.

```
podium tasks list
```

Tasks are created, assigned, moved, and started from the **Roadmap** page in the
web UI.

*More commands and flags are added as later phases land; each gets an entry here
when it ships.*
