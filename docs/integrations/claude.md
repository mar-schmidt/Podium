# Claude Integration

Status: Phase 2 implemented.

Podium drives Claude Code as a per-turn process. The daemon owns the durable
Podium session and launches `claude` for each turn with the agent workspace as
`cwd`.

## Launch

Base command:

```text
claude -p \
  --input-format stream-json \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --include-partial-messages \
  --verbose \
  --replay-user-messages
```

Optional flags:

| Setting | Claude flag |
| --- | --- |
| Session provider handle | `--resume <claude-session-id>` |
| Model | `--model <name>` |
| Effort | `--effort <low|medium|high|xhigh|max>` |
| `yolo` permission mode | `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` |

When a profile is set, Podium exports `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<profile.config_dir>`.
When no profile is set, Podium leaves `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` unset so Claude uses
its normal global login.

## Instructions

Before a turn, core composes the agent instructions and writes
`agents/<name>/workspace/CLAUDE.md`. The file is Podium-managed and contains
absolute `@` imports in this order:

1. `$PODIUM_HOME/AGENTS.md`
2. `$PODIUM_HOME/agents/<name>/AGENTS.md` when present
3. `$PODIUM_HOME/agents/<name>/SOUL.md`

Claude auto-discovers `CLAUDE.md` because the workspace is the process cwd.

## Streaming

Podium writes stream-json user input on stdin and parses Claude stream-json on
stdout. The adapter handles:

| Claude event | Podium behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `system.session_id` / `result.session_id` | Persist as provider handle. |
| nested `stream_event.content_block_delta.delta.text` | Stream as assistant delta. |
| `assistant.message.content` / `result.result` | Use as final assistant text for durable history. |

When resuming with `--resume`, Podium sends only the new user turn. It does not
also replay canonical history into an already-resumed Claude session.

## Permissions

`approve` mode generates a temporary MCP config in `workspace/.podium/` and adds:

```text
--mcp-config <generated-json>
--permission-prompt-tool mcp__podium_permission__prompt
```

The generated MCP server command is:

```text
podiumd permission-mcp --addr <daemon-addr> --turn <turn-id> --timeout <duration>
```

The hidden MCP helper exposes one tool, `prompt`. For each Claude permission
request it POSTs to the daemon permission broker. The CLI receives the request
on the live chat stream, prompts the user, and POSTs the decision back.

Decision payloads:

```json
{"behavior":"allow","updatedInput":{...}}
{"behavior":"deny","message":"Denied by user"}
```

The MCP `tools/call` response is a single text block containing that JSON. This
shape was verified against Claude Code during Phase 2.

If no decision arrives before `global.permission_timeout`, the daemon returns
`{"behavior":"deny"}` so Claude does not block indefinitely.
