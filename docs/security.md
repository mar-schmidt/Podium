# Security & logging

This page documents Podium's security posture and the structured run logging it
emits. It reflects the implementation as shipped in v1 (requirements §8.6, §10,
R11.5) and is the reference checked during the Phase 9 security review pass.

## Threat model in one line

Podium is a **single-user, localhost daemon** that orchestrates agent CLIs which
already have access to the user's machine and accounts. Podium does not add a
sandbox; it adds a **deliberate approval boundary** and keeps sensitive
configuration out of logs and client payloads.

## Permission modes

Every session and scheduled run carries a permission mode (R5.18–R5.21, §8.4):

| Mode | Meaning | How it is enforced |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `approve` *(default)* | Each tool call is relayed to a human who allows or denies it. | Claude: an MCP permission server (`--permission-prompt-tool`) → daemon broker → UI/CLI. Codex: `approvalPolicy: on-request` + `sandbox: read-only`, relayed through the same broker. |
| `yolo` *(opt-in)* | Every tool call is auto-approved. | Claude: `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`. Codex: `approvalPolicy: never` + `sandbox: danger-full-access`. |

**`yolo` is whole-machine access by design (R8.31).** Podium does *not* pretend
the workspace is a sandbox in `yolo` — the only guard is the explicit opt-in and
the `approve` default. Because of this, Podium surfaces an explicit warning every
time `yolo` is selected:

- CLI `podium agents create … --permission yolo` prints a whole-machine warning.
- The `/permission yolo` slash command returns a notice spelling out that the
  workspace is not a sandbox and how to switch back.
- The web "Hire agent" modal labels the option `yolo · full access`.

The mandatory `approve` auto-deny timeout (`global.permission_timeout`) ensures a
blocked permission prompt never hangs an agent indefinitely (R8.18): if no human
decision arrives in time, the broker returns *deny*.

### Unattended runs (scheduler / roadmap pickup)

Scheduled fires and server-side task pickups have no human to answer a prompt
(§7.7), so they never use the interactive relay. They run either:

- `yolo` — whole-machine, deliberate; or
- `preapproved` *(default, stricter)* — an allow-list. Claude enforces it
  natively via `--allowedTools`; Codex/fake consult the in-process
  `core.AllowListRelay`. **An empty allow-list denies everything.**

## Sensitive data handling

### MCP configuration & credentials (R8.29)

A generated MCP config may embed server commands, local URLs, tokens, or
credentials. Podium treats `Agent.MCPConfig` as sensitive:

- It is tagged `json:"-"` on the store model, so it is **redacted at every JSON
  boundary** — both the REST API and the WebSocket `state` message — in one place.
  (`internal/store/redaction_test.go` locks this contract.)
- It is never written to a log line. The per-turn Claude MCP config file written
  into `workspace/.podium/` is created `0600` and removed after the turn.

### System prompts / developer instructions (R8.30)

Composed agent instructions (the base `AGENTS.md` + per-agent `AGENTS.md` +
`SOUL.md`, delivered as Claude `CLAUDE.md` `@`-imports or a Codex bundle) are an
internal `[]byte` payload handed to the adapter. They are **never** placed in any
client DTO (`store.Agent`, `store.Session`, `store.Message`) and are never logged.

### Profile / auth isolation (R8.32, R8.34–R8.37)

A profile is *just a directory name*. Podium maps it to the backing CLI's own
config dir via an environment variable and **never handles credentials**:

- Claude: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<profile.config_dir>`
- Codex: `CODEX_HOME=<profile.home_dir>`

When no profile is set, Podium **unsets** that variable so the CLI uses its normal
global login — it never leaks one profile's variable into another profile's
process. (Agent *workspaces* are intentionally shared across agents, §5.8; it is
only the auth state that stays isolated.)

### GitHub project repo tokens

Podium's GitHub project integration is local-first and does not ship a GitHub App
private key or client secret. The distributed app contains only public GitHub App
details (`app_slug`, `client_id`). Users authorize the app with GitHub's device
flow, and Podium stores the returned local token under
`$PODIUM_HOME/github/token.json` with `0600` permissions.

GitHub tokens, temporary archive redirect URLs, and downloaded archive URLs are
treated as sensitive and must not be logged or returned from API responses.
Connected repositories are downloaded as source snapshots into project `repo/`
subdirectories; v1 does not create Git remotes, commits, pushes, or PRs.

## Structured run logging (R11.5)

`podiumd` logs structured records (Go `slog`, text handler) for both
**interactive** and **scheduled** runs, so every agent run is auditable. Logs are
written to stderr and `$PODIUM_HOME/logs/podiumd.log` (default
`~/.podium/logs/podiumd.log`), rotate daily, and keep `logging.retention_days`
calendar days (default 7).

Interactive turns (`internal/core`, tagged `event=run`):

| Message | Emitted when | Key fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `turn started` | a turn begins | `session`, `agent`, `origin`, `unattended`, `provider`, `profile`, `permission` |
| `turn fallback` | a rate limit steps the fallback chain | `from`, `to` |
| `turn finished` | the assistant reply is persisted | `provider`, `reply_bytes` |
| `turn aborted` | the client/stream cancelled mid-turn | `provider` |
| `turn failed` | an error at compose/dispatch/fallback/persist | `stage`, `error` |

Scheduled runs (`internal/schedule`) log `scheduled run started` /
`scheduled run finished` / `scheduled run failed` and `task picked up`, each
linked to the durable session and run record.

Log records intentionally carry **identifiers and outcomes, not payloads** — no
message bodies, instructions, or MCP config — consistent with the redaction rules
above.

The CLI can inspect logs with `podium logs path` and `podium logs follow`. The
web UI reads the same log through loopback-only `/api/logs` endpoints; these are
not available to non-loopback clients because provider diagnostics may include
sensitive local troubleshooting details even after redaction.

## Cross-platform process control (R10.1–R10.4)

- **Binary discovery** resolves `claude`/`codex` via `<NAME>_BIN` overrides, then
  PATH (Windows `PATHEXT` resolves `.cmd`/`.exe`/`.bat` shims), then conventional
  npm global locations.
- **Hung-agent cancellation** uses context cancellation plus a process-**group**
  kill so the CLI *and* its children (npm shim → node → workers) die together:
  a negative-PID `SIGKILL` on Unix, `taskkill /T /F` on Windows.
- **Paths** use `path/filepath` and `~` expansion throughout; `PODIUM_HOME` is
  resolved to an absolute path at startup so a relative override or a daemon
  `chdir` cannot relocate the storage root.

All OS-specific behaviour is isolated to `internal/exec` and `internal/config`.
