// Package notify delivers "an agent needs you" signals to out-of-app
// destinations: the OS notification tray via Web Push today, and — behind the
// same Channel seam — native APNs/FCM push later. It is deliberately decoupled
// from core/server: callers hand it a Notification and a set of Channels, and
// each Channel owns its own transport and subscription storage.
//
// In-app signalling (toasts, red dots) is NOT this package's job; that is
// driven live off the WebSocket. notify is only for reaching a user who is not
// currently looking at the dashboard.
